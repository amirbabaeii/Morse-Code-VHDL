<h1>Morse Code VHDL</h1>

A VHDL project for printing alphabet corresponding to its Morse code on VGA monitor.

It uses two buttons on the FPGA board as dashes and dots, and a button for spaces.

This project is made in ISE Design Suite, and the hardware is Xilinx Spartan-6 xc6slx9 FPGA.

My hardware had memory limit, so I commented line 899 to 962 in monitor.vhd so it can synthesize.

Hope it's useful for you:)
